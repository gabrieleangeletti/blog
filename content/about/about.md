Hi, I'm Gabriele! A software engineer and rock climbing addict on a journey to location independence.

I have been living in London for the past couple of years, working on self-driving cars at [Lyft](https://level5.lyft.com/). I was enjoying my life there, but I've always had this inner need to experience more of the beauty the world has to offer. That's why I left my job and embarked on this journey to become location independent. Or digital nomad, as they call it these days.

I was never a big traveller. I never left Europe until I was 26,  when I went to India. Then Indonesia this year, and after that it was a matter of time before I would leave everything and give it a shot.

When not programming, I spend my time either climbing or searching for the best coffee out there. Also, you can often find me trying to cook some exotic asian dish.

I use this blog to share thoughts and blabbering about software engineering topics. I hope you will learn something from it. If you do, I would love to hear about it.

Also, I'm available for hiring!
